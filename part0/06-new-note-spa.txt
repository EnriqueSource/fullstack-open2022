note over browser:
The new note is created and added to the notes page
directly from the browser.
To do this, the browser executes the javascript code contained
in the spa.js resource.
This resource had already been downloaded with the requests
prior to the creation of the note.
Therefore, it is not necessary to make a new request or download.
With SPA it is only necessary to send a copy of the new "notes" (data.JSON)
page to the server so that the server saves the changes.
The browser itself refreshes the notes page so that the changes
appear on the display.
